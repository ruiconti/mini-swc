# A planner's plan

## Code-wise

- Improve borrowing: Get rid of `clone()` and `to_<type>()`
- Make better usage of `trait` and mechanic composition -- e.g. `Asset` module

## Feature-wise

- Add support for na√Øve bundling
    - [ ] Simulate on a smaller repository what that would mean
        1. Imports from 3rd party apps e.g. `import { someFunc } from 'a-package'`
        2. Imports directly from files from 3rd party apps e.g. `import { someFunc } from 'a-package/lib/utils'`
        3. Imports from files in the same package e.g. `import someFunc from './utils/someFunc'`
    - [ ] Simulate what bundling would mean, in that context
- Implement dependency graph using a way more efficient graph map structure, available on petgraph crate: https://docs.rs/petgraph/latest/petgraph/
    - Add support for graphviz
- Calculate bundle-size, per package
- Calculate a traversal between an entrypoint and a specific module
- Simulate `webpack`'s chunking system, in an attempt to generate a bundlestat.json file w/o building
- Add a chunking system aware of intentional chunk splitting per dynamic imports
